Hey Replit, implement a responsive image-based homework assistance feature using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision capabilities. Please:

1. Create a responsive ImageUploader component with:
   - Drag-and-drop file upload area that adapts to screen size
   - Native camera access for mobile devices
   - Touch-friendly controls for image capture/selection
   - File size and type validation
   - Upload progress indicator
   - Image preview with mobile-friendly cropping/rotating capabilities

2. Implement the image processing backend:
   - Set up a secure file upload handler to Supabase Storage
   - Create an API endpoint that sends the image to OpenAI's Vision API
   - Include appropriate prompt engineering for educational context
   - Process and return the AI response

3. Build a responsive ImageQuestionForm component that:
   - Adapts layout for different screen sizes
   - Allows users to add optional text context to their image
   - Includes subject and topic selection for better context
   - Provides specific question prompts (e.g., "Solve this," "Explain this")
   - Shows a history of recently uploaded images

4. Implement response handling:
   - Format AI responses with proper markdown for equations (MathJax)
   - Extract step-by-step solutions from complex problems
   - Highlight key concepts and formulas
   - Provide options to request clarification or simplification

5. Add specialized handlers for common homework types:
   - Math problem solving with step-by-step solutions
   - Science diagram explanations
   - Language and grammar corrections
   - Historical document analysis

6. Ensure mobile optimization:
   - Compress images before upload
   - Optimize UI for small screens and touch interaction
   - Handle intermittent connectivity
   - Provide offline access to previous responses

7. Implement a caching mechanism specifically for image-based queries
   - Store image hashes to identify duplicate uploads
   - Cache responses for similar images
   - Implement a cleanup policy for storage management
